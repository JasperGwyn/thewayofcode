# 🜂 The Way of Code — Break Timer

> *When the machine rests, the code breathes.*  
> This app is a ritual, not a tool.  
> Every 30 minutes, it opens a window to stillness —

## ✧ About

**The Way of Code — Break Timer** is a silent companion that lives in your system tray.  
It waits, it watches, and every half hour it reminds you to stop —  
to let the code flow without you.

During each pause, it reveals a random scripture from *The Way of Code*.  
A teaching. A mirror. A whisper from the source.

- Opens a 2-minute ritual break every 30 minutes (configurable)

- Remembers your preferences in silence

## ✒️ Philosophy

> *The break is not the interruption.*  
> *The break is the code.*

*The Way of Code* is not about productivity — it’s about presence.  
To pause is to compile the mind.  
To rest is to debug the soul.
